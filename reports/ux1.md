# User Experience - Team *T16* 

The report summarizes a round of user experience testing performed on the team's application.

Each developer should ask the user to accomplish one or more simple tasks while monitoring their efforts.  
The user should attempt to complete the tasks without any aid from the developer.
Use a pseudonym to identify the user below. 
Age, nationality, and other background information can sometimes be helpful understanding the problems a user encountered.

Your team should identify additional tasks to explore your application more fully and alter the time limit if necessary.
