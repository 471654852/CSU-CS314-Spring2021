## Planned Epics

Team 404 Brain Not Found plans on completing the Team Identification, About, Trip, Place Details and Maps Epics.
Team Identification includes the subtasks: Set the team on the server, Set the team name in the client application, and Set the team name in the browser tab.
We plan on completing this epic and have it ready for deployment by Saturday to ensure that team members working on the about epic will have more time to work on it. Sam is in charge of setting the team on the server, Mark is in charge of setting the team name in the client application, and Tomas is in charge of setting the team name in the browser tab. Ideally, this epic should be very quick to complete and so, once, done, we will notify team members on slack.

About includes the subtasks: Update the design document for the addition of team and member information, Add the components without content to create the structure, Write a team mission statement, Create a team image, Add "team member" image, name, bio. Once the team identification epic is complete, we will assign the rest of the tasks within the about epic. Right now, we are temporarily assigning Si Fan to work on Updating the design document for the addition of team and member information and Yuxin to Adding the components without content to create the structure.

Trip includes: Create a list of places that have been clicked, Display the list of places that have been clicked with the most recent first, Clear the entire list to start over, Remove individual entries from the list. We will decide who will be assigned to these subtasks once the previous epics have been completed.

Place details includes the subtasks: Create a reverse geocoding utility function and add geographic details to the popup and the list. We will decide who will be assigned to these subtasks once the previous epics have been completed. This epic is plannned to be completed by Wednesday, February 3rd. So that we have enough time to deploy the server by Thursday evening.

Maps includes: Choose a list of background maps for the user to select from, Add an icon to the map that allows  the user to choose from the list of maps, and Remember the map selection for future sessions. We will plan to have this epic completed by Wednesday February 3rd so that we can have are deployment ready to go by Thursday. This is an ambitious attempt for our team and we are going to try our best. We would like to complete all five epics.
