## Planned Epics

### Modify tour

This epic will add a great feature for our users. First we need to have a data structure that we can copy the old order of the old trip while allowing the user to select a new starting point. We also would like to provide the user with the option of reversing the order of the trip while maintaining the starting location. Another task will be allowing the user to reorder the individual destinations. The user will also be provided with functionality to remove individual destinations. A feature we would like to add is to allow the user to add information about individual places as well as correct any wrong information. Lastly we will need a function that will render the updated trip with this new information.

### Search More
This epic adds even more searching capabilities to our program.
