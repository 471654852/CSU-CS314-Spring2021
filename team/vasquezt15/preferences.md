# Preferences for Tomas Vasquez

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Any of those mediums works. I have equal access to all of them at anytime.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * We will all get an "A"
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I am working on being more patient.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Lack of preparation and organization which leads to poor performance. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I dont think that shooting for a "B" is acceptable and I would make that known if the issue came up.  If someone is only capable of B quality work and thats the best they can do. I would work to help them so that the overall effect is "A" quality work. 
     If someone just doesnt care then I would try to address that with them and later go to the instructor.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Yes, however, everyone should have an equal opportunity to contribute. But if some team members choose to do less work that is their prorogative up until it becomes a detriment to the team.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   *  CS270 and CS253 took about 15 hours a piece. I expect this class to take the same amount of time.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I recomended to my group that we have a plan going into meetings to address different roles we can take on throughout the semester.  
   * I expect that we will all get an equal opportunity to participate in any such role and that we will all be willing to take on any role that is requiered for team succes.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I expect all of us to communicate daily and update eachother on the progress we are making and timeline to complete our tasks.
   * If we do that then it will be evident if someone is falling behind and it can be addressed before it hurts the team.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Clear expections aught to be set for what is acceptable work. I expect everyone to fall inline with what the team agrees is acceptable.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We need to communicate with eachother and give the team timelines as to when we will work on projects and how long we expect task to take.
   * We need to coordinate joint task.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I am indifferent to having a standing meeting time. But I do expect to meet regularly and for everyone to be available for comunication throughout most of their available hours.
   * Its ok if things come up, but communicating that one is not available during a certain period that the team expects availability is crucial.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Its hard to say without looking at the nature of the work first. I expect to meet regularly to discuss progress.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Probably not. It depends on the nature of the change. If you are completing a task within the scope of what was discussed when that task was assigned, you shoudnt need team approval.
   * That would be slow and inefficient. Howveer, if you are materially changing the nature of a task or making unasigned changes to a project then that should be discussed.
   * As long as you stay within the scope of your task and complete it in the way that it was discussed in the team meeting you should be fine not to ask everyone. Howveer, you should still have it reviewed to make sure you are not breaking the expectations of the team.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Handle it democratically. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Depends on what you mean about dominating the team process. If they are not listening to anyone and pushing their ideas on the team without allowing discussion of disagreement- then thats a problem.
   * I would address it by taking with that person. They might not even realize that their team feels like their voice is being muted.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Communicate with the team and express that.
