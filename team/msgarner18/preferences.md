# Preferences for Mark Garner

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, slack, teams, email. Anytime.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Finish everything on time. Good Grade. Learn group skills.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Actively engage with the team rather than working on my own.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * indecisiveness, social anxiety, not asking for help.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * We have a conversation until everyone is on the same page.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I would rather our team be successful over ensuring that everybody is contributing exactly equally however, if it seems that a team member is taking advantage of this, we should talk with them to see what's up.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I anticipate 1-4 hours per day depending on the day, but I'm willing to spend as much time as is necessary to see my group succeed.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * At first, we should have a discussion and continue to be aware of eachother's strengths as we continue to work together.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We should check in with each other often enough so that missed commitments aren't large and difficult to address when they occur. In this case, we should be gracious, but also hold them accountable.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We will have a discussion and reach a compromise.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We will have a discussion and reach a compromise.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I am okay with either and both depending on the situation. A standing meeting time will make it so we don't have to spend so much time and energy planning around schedules for each meeting, but sometimes, we will likely need to adapt depending on the situation.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * We will have to decide that as we go. I am thinking that, at first, we should schedule a meeting before each group assignment in order to checkin and then figure out a flow from there.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * As a general rule, yes.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Perhaps take a bit of time to see if we can't come to a unanimous decision, but if that is off the table, we will go with the majority.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * We should attempt to be more assertive in our contributions and if that doesn't work, call it out and talk about it.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will express this concern to my team graciously.
