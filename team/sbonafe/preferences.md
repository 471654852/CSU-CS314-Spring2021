# Preferences for Sam Bonafe

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, slack, team, email. Anytime.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Finish everything on time. Communicate and work together. Also, help the team to increase their personal skills.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Continously be available and communicate everything I am working on.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Not prioritizing tasks correctly and allocating enough time for work.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * That will depend on several talks and an eventual compromise.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I believe it is acceptable as long as no one takes advantage of this idea. Some will be more advanced and can teach those who are not at the same level. Therefore, doing more work. However, everyone should be there learning and giving their all.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * It is hard to judge what the adequate amount of time will be. I am willing to put as much effort forth that is required.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * An upfront discussion will help at first, but through time it will be easier to tell where people would work best.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * They should be held accountable and hopefully this never happens. Communicate early and we can work together as a team to accomplish the week's work.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * This is easy to happen. That is where communication becomes extremely important.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Communication and understanding.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, we should have established meeting times.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * We will have to base that off of work flow. Maybe start with more time and adjust as needed.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * As a team, I think that would be the best.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Usually, that would mean the majority.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * This is an odd question. I would talk with them. Are they the team leader?
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will bring this to my teams' attention.
